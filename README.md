# Halftonify

This is a simple program you can use to apply the popular "halftone" effect to any image.

Features:
* Adjust halftone dot size
* Toggle grid and gridline numbers
* Colour dots differently by their size

This project is less for the artistic effect (go download Photoshop or any smilarly popular image editor for that), and more for the DIY art project potential (as you can hopefully tell by the odd list of features above).

We made this with it. We drew a grid by hand and drilled at the intersections, but you could also try printing the image on multiple sheets, taping it on, and drilling through the paper.
